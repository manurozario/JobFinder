# JobFinder
Used Python and Beautiful Soup to scrape data from [Times Jobs]([https://pages.github.com/](https://www.timesjobs.com/). Objective was to find jobs with the keyword 'Python', filter to include most recents jobs posted a few days ago and omitted postings with skills I am unfamiliar with. The extracted data is stored onto job_updates.txt and can be updated every 10 minutes if the code is running.
