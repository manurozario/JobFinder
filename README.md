# JobFinder
Used Python and Beautiful Soup to scrape data from timesjobs.com , specifically job postings with the keyword python. Filtered the postings out to the most recents jobs psoted a few days ago and omitted postings with skills I am unfamiliar with. The extracted data is stored onto job_updates.txt and updated every 10 minutes.
